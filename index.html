								<h3>Dear freshmen of IITR</h3>
								<p>
									Congratulations!<br>
									You just managed to crack one of the toughest entrance exams in the world and survived the godforsaken counselling period! Now if at all you wake up in the morning and feel a little nauseated, dizzy or wonder what your future college is going to be like, then don’t worry!<br>

												<h2><strong>Foreword</strong></h2>
											</header>
											<p>Any normal handbook/website-created-by-so-called-geeks will not tell you the painful yet insanely awesome realities of the college life.</p>
											<p>The writers of the guide don’t claim that they will either, as after all, reality is a very relative concept.</p><br>
											<p>However if at all you are interested in knowing:</p><br>
											<ul>
											<li>Why burning laboratories is just not the IITR way?</li>
											<li>Where to get the best maggie at 3am in the morning?</li>
											<li>Why politics in IITR can remind you of a Shyam Benegal thriller?</li>
											<li>How to crack the recruitment interviews of different societies of IITR?</li>
											<li>Who is Bhuppi?</li>
											</ul><br>
											<p>Then this is the book you should be reading.</p>
											<ul class="actions">
												<li><a href="#" target="_blank" id="download" class="button button-icon fa fa-download">-Coming Soon-</a></li>
											</ul><br>
											<p>And remember, whatever happens.</p>

					<h2>Excerpts from the book</h2>
					<h3>Inane Campus rules:</h3>

					<!-- Banner -->
						<section id="banner" class="container">
							<p>Stepping on lawns is strictly prohibited. You might get shot at sight, or worse, be exposed to two and a half hours of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2bFsQWaDTg">Gunda</a>. There are exceptions of course; like if it's your convo, or poly results are being announced..</p>
						</section>
						
					<!-- Banner -->
						<section id="banner" class="container">
							<p>Conversing/Looking at/Walking with the females in front of KB or SB is banned.</p>
						</section>

					<!-- Banner -->
						<section id="banner" class="container">
							<p>Sleeping in the library is prohibited. You’d think it is obvious, but wait till you open textbooks in library. The induced sleep can knock you out in seconds. On the other hand, watching TV Shows with your paramour and PDA in the journal section is not.</p>
						</section>

					<!-- Banner -->
						<section id="banner" class="container">
							<p>The girls are locked in their Bhawans after 10pm. Yes, locked in! And all notices referring to them as ‘inmates’ don't help much either.</p>
						</section>

					<!-- Banner -->
						<section id="banner" class="container">
							<p>Under no circumstances should you send cheeky messages or poke the better looking females of the institute on online social media without knowing them personally. It might result in you getting reported or blocked or both.</p>
						</section>

					<!-- Banner -->
						<section id="banner" class="container">
							<p>Asking a fellow fresher his JEE rank is fine, as long as you don’t tell yours in response.</p>
						</section>

					<h3>#The guide has everything</h3>

					<!-- Banner -->
						<section id="banner" class="container">
							<p>#history<br>The institute has its roots way back in 1845. It was the time when speaking in a british accent did not make you a homo. It was also the time when people dressed up in 3-piece suits just to go have dinner in the Bhawan messes (where they were served in silverware by turbaned waiters)!</p>
						</section>

					<!-- Banner -->
						<section id="banner" class="container">
							<p>#tradition<br>Although everyone signs the undertaking form which promises that they won’t be going anywhere near the canal or aquedcut, there’s hardly any undergrad who hasn’t visited it once.</p>
						</section>

					<!-- Banner -->
						<section id="banner" class="container">
							<p>#bakkar<br>The most path breaking research of course happens in the Civil department. This is because most of their research tends to involve breaking down existing roads and laying them again, in the hope of finding that elusive X to Y ratio, where X and Y are two materials no one else in the institute has any idea about.</p>
						</section>
						
					<!-- Banner -->
						<section id="banner" class="container">
							<p>#information<br>By now you must be aware of the places called Prakash, Sagar and Olive.But what about the place that’s even open at 3am in the morning and perhaps serves the best maggi in the whole town of Roorkee?<br>Or<br>the place which is also known as the Mona-lisa of chicken shacks in Roorkee?</p>
						</section>
					
					<h3>definitions</h3>
					<!-- Banner -->
						<section id="banner" class="container">
							<p>Chapo:<br>Traditionally meaning chai-pakoda, this term has been now reduced to mean party or treat, or in the worst case, as a euphemism for ‘I like you, but I don’t really have any topic to talk with you. Can we meet?’<br>“Hey Meenakshi! What about your birthday chapo?”<br>“My birthday was last month. Jerk.”</p>
						</section>

					<!-- Banner -->
						<section id="banner" class="container">
							<p>Tut<br>Short for tutorial. Refers to an assignment professors give in the (unrealistic) hope of students completing it by themselves and submitting. Have some weightage in your final CG, so don’t risk even trying to solve it yourself.<br>“This Maths tut is like a girl’s attention. I just don’t get it.“</p>
						</section>

					<!-- Banner -->
						<section id="banner" class="container">
							<p>Bakchod<br> A term used to describe someone who frequently indulges in Bakchodi.<br>or<br>A worthless person or thing.<br>or<br>Any course offered by the Humanities department.<br>“Rajeev bakchod banda hai yaar. He still believes RG should’ve been the PM of this country.”<p>
